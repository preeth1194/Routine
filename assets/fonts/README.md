## Satoshi (Body text)

To use Satoshi for body text:

1. Download Satoshi from [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) (free)
2. Copy `Satoshi-Regular.otf` and optionally `Satoshi-Medium.otf` to this directory
3. Uncomment the Satoshi loading in `app/_layout.tsx`
4. Update `constants/theme.ts` typography to use `Satoshi-Regular` for body

Until then, the app uses Plus Jakarta Sans for both headings and body.
